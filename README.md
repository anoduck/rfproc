> A bash script to batch process data files from rtl_433.

## Install

To install simply copy `rfproc` to somewhere in your path. Currently, `~/.local/bin` seems to be a popular choice, but if you have `~/bin` in your path, it works all the same.

You do need to have bash, awk, [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd), and rtl_433 installed.

```sh
cp rfproc ~/.local/bin
```

## Usage

Currently, there are only two actions to perform using `rfproc`, these actions are `proc` to process files in batch and the `clean` command to remove all filetypes that are generated by `rfproc proc`.
The later really should only be run for development of rfproc, and in all other situations ignored.
